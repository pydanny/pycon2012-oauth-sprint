===================================================
Welcome to the PyCon 2012 OAuth Sprint page!
===================================================

We're going to make Python's OAuth story better!

* When: March 12 - 15, 2012
* Where: Santa Clara Hotel and around the world

Plan
======

#. Get Oauth 1.0a working well. After that's done, work on implementing against select OAuth 2 specifications.
#. Clean up existing OAuth consumers and providers.
#. Document everything.
#. Increase test coverage on everything.
#. Add a page to http://docs.python-guide.org that is the Python OAuth story.
#. Describe a specification for a high level of quality in an OAuth-based project. Those who meet this specification get their project listed on the forthcoming http://docs.python-guide.org page.

Communication
===============

* IRC channel: forthcoming
* Twitter hashtag: #pycon-oauth

Schedule
=========

Monday
------

OAuthlib and general cleanup

* OAuthlib: Idan Gazit and a select group of others work to get OAuthlib to a state where consumer and provider authors can use this new library. 

    * .. warning:: I can't put up a wall around Idan, so I'm going to ask that people refrain from distracting him until OAuthlib is ready to go.
    
* Authors of existing OAuth Consumer and Provider tools can work to close out existing bugs, fix documentation, and increase test coverage.

Tuesday
--------

* blah blah
